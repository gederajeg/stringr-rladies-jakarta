Large size in stockings is hard to sell.
The salt breeze came across from the sea.
Note closely the size of the gas tank.
The crooked maze failed to fool the mouse.
The walled town was seized without a fight.
The slang word for raw whiskey is booze.
The pirates seized the crew of the lost ship.
An abrupt start does not win the prize.
On the islands the sea breeze is soft and mild.
To make pure ice, you freeze water.
Both brothers wear the same size.
A zestful food is the hot-cross bun.
All sat frozen and watched the screen.
Pink clouds floated JTith the breeze.
A cold dip restores health and zest.
The marsh will freeze when cold enough.
The youth drove with zest, but little skill.
